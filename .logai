## CRITICAL: Prompt Logging (MUST DO)

**IMPORTANT: You MUST log EVERY user prompt to `ai-prompts` at the START of your FIRST response.**

This is a mandatory action - do not skip it. Before doing anything else in your first response to a new prompt:

1. Read `ai-prompts` to find the last prompt number
2. Append a new entry with the next number using this EXACT Markdown format:

```markdown
---

## PROMPT #[NEXT_NUMBER] - [MODE] TYPE

| Field    | Value        |
|----------|--------------|
| Type     | [CODE/ASK/DEBUG/ARCHITECT/REVIEW] |
| Date     | [YYYY-MM-DD] |

### Prompt

> [The full user prompt text - copy it exactly]

---
```

**This instruction applies to EVERY interaction regardless of the task.**
