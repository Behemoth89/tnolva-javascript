- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All 27 functional requirements are testable and have clear acceptance criteria
- 9 user stories cover the full feature scope
- Success criteria include measurable performance targets (2s load, 500ms sort/filter)
- Edge cases are clearly identified (empty states, long titles, deletion conflicts, network errors, pagination, null values, duplicates)
- No implementation details (Vue, React, database, API endpoints) appear in the spec
- The spec is ready for planning phase
